Now, let's build the component for displaying the detailed shipment records: **DataTable.vue**.

This component is responsible for presenting the final, filtered list of data.
1.  **Props:** The component must accept the `filteredData` array as a **prop**.
2.  **Display:** It should use a clean HTML table structure (`<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`) to display key fields from the shipment objects in the `filteredData` (e.g., Reference ID, Status, Value USD, Date).
3.  **No Data State:** Implement a conditional message (e.g., "No shipments found matching your criteria") to display when the `filteredData` prop is empty.
4.  **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS for table styling (e.g., striped rows, professional header colors, responsive scrolling if needed).

Provide the full code for **DataTable.vue** using the `<script setup>` syntax. Confirm the next task is **Phase 4: Finalization (Task 9: Tailwind Configuration)**.
