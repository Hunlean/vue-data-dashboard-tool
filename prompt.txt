Now, we must configure Tailwind CSS for the project.

Please provide the content for two files:
1.  **`tailwind.config.js`**: Provide the full content for this file. The `content` array must be correctly configured to scan all Vue and JavaScript files (`./index.html`, `./src/**/*.{vue,js,ts,jsx,tsx}`) so Tailwind can find and include the necessary classes in the final CSS output.
2.  **`src/assets/main.css`**: Provide the full content for this file. It must contain the three primary Tailwind directives (`@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, `@tailwind utilities;`) to inject Tailwind's styles into the application.

After providing the content for both files, confirm the next task is **Task 10: Final Review**.
